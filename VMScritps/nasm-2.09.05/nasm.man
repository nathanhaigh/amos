       The nnaassmm command assembles the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e and directs output to  the
       file  _o_u_t_f_i_l_e  if  specified.  If  _o_u_t_f_i_l_e  is not specified, nnaassmm will
       derive a default output file name from the name of its input file, usu-
       ally  by  appending ‘.o’ or ‘.obj’, or by removing all extensions for a
       raw binary file. Failing that, the output file name will be ‘nasm.out’.

   OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --@@ _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Causes  nnaassmm  to  process  options from _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e as if they were
              included on the command line.

       --aa     Causes nnaassmm to assemble  the  given  input  file  without  first
              applying the macro preprocessor.

       --DD _m_a_c_r_o_[_=_v_a_l_u_e_]
              Pre-defines a single-line macro.

       --dd _m_a_c_r_o_[_=_v_a_l_u_e_]
              Same as the --DD option.

       --ee     Causes  nnaassmm  to  preprocess the given input file, and write the
              output to _s_t_d_o_u_t (or the specified output file  name),  and  not
              actually assemble anything.

       --ff _f_o_r_m_a_t
              Specifies  the output file format. To see a list of valid output
              formats, use the --hhff option.

       --gg     Causes nnaassmm to generate debug information in selected format

       --hh     Causes nnaassmm to exit immediately, after giving a summary  of  its
              invocation options.

       --hhff    Same as --hh , but also lists all valid output formats.

       --II _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              Adds  a  directory  to  the  search  path for include files. The
              directory specification must include the trailing slash,  as  it
              will be directly prepended to the name of the include file.

       --ii _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
              Same as the --II option.

       --ll _l_i_s_t_f_i_l_e
              Causes  an assembly listing to be directed to the given file, in
              which the original source is displayed on the  right  hand  side
              (plus the source for included files and the expansions of multi-
              line macros) and the generated code is shown in hex on the left.

       --MM     Causes  nnaassmm  to  output  Makefile-style dependencies to stdout;
              normal output is suppressed.

       --MMGG _f_i_l_e
              Same as --MM but assumes that  missing  Makefile  dependecies  are
              generated and added to dependency list without a prefix.

       --MMFF _f_i_l_e
              Output Makefile-style dependencies to the specified file.

       --MMDD _f_i_l_e
              Same as a combination of --MM and --MMFF options.

       --MMTT _f_i_l_e
              Override  the  default  name of the dependency target dependency
              target name. This is normally the same as the  output  filename,
              specified by the --oo option.

       --MMQQ _f_i_l_e
              The  same  as  --MMTT except it tries to quote characters that have
              special meaning in Makefile syntax. This is  not  foolproof,  as
              not all characters with special meaning are quotable in Make.

       --MMPP    Emit phony target

       --OO _n_u_m_b_e_r
              Optimize branch offsets.
              --OO00 :No optimization (default)
              --OO11 :Minimal optimization
              --OOxx :Multipass optimization (recommended)

       --oo _o_u_t_f_i_l_e
              Specifies  a precise name for the output file, overriding nnaassmm’s
              default means of determining it.

       --PP _f_i_l_e
              Specifies a file to be pre-included, before the main source file
              starts to be processed.

       --pp _f_i_l_e
              Same as the --PP option.

       --rr     Causes  nnaassmm  to  exit immediately, after displaying its version
              number.  _(_o_b_s_o_l_e_t_e_)

       --ss     Causes nnaassmm to send its error messages and/or help text to  _s_t_d_-
              _o_u_t instead of _s_t_d_e_r_r.

       --tt     Causes nnaassmm to assemble in SciTech TASM compatible mode

       --UU _m_a_c_r_o
              Undefines a single-line macro.

       --uu _m_a_c_r_o
              Same as the --UU option.

       --vv     Causes  nnaassmm  to  exit immediately, after displaying its version
              number.

       --ww_[_+_-_]_f_o_o
              Causes nnaassmm to enable or disable certain classes of warning mes-
              sages, for example --ww++oorrpphhaann--llaabbeellss or --ww--mmaaccrroo--ppaarraammss

       --XX _f_o_r_m_a_t
              specifies error reporting format (gnu or vc).

       --ZZ _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Causes nnaassmm to redirect error messages to _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  This option
              exists to support operating  systems  on  which  stderr  is  not
              easily redirected.

       ----pprreeffiixx

       ----ppoossttffiixx
              Prepend  or  append  (respectively)  the  given  argument to all
              global or extern variables.


   SSYYNNTTAAXX
       This man page does not fully describe the  syntax  of  nnaassmm’s  assembly
       language,  but does give a summary of the differences from other assem-
       blers.

       _R_e_g_i_s_t_e_r_s have no leading ‘%’  sign,  unlike  ggaass,  and  floating-point
       stack registers are referred to as _s_t_0, _s_t_1, and so on.

       _F_l_o_a_t_i_n_g_-_p_o_i_n_t  _i_n_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_o_n_s  may use either the single-operand form or
       the double. A _T_O keyword is provided; thus, one could either write

                      fadd st0,st1
                      fadd st1,st0

       or one could use the alternative single-operand forms

                      fadd st1
                      fadd to st1

       _U_n_i_n_i_t_i_a_l_i_s_e_d _s_t_o_r_a_g_e is reserved using the  _R_E_S_B,  _R_E_S_W,  _R_E_S_D,  _R_E_S_Q,
       _R_E_S_T and _R_E_S_O pseudo-opcodes, each taking one parameter which gives the
       number of bytes, words, doublewords, quadwords  or  ten-byte  words  to
       reserve.

       _R_e_p_e_t_i_t_i_o_n  of data items is not done by the _D_U_P keyword as seen in DOS
       assemblers, but by the use of the _T_I_M_E_S prefix, like this:

             message: times 3 db ’abc’
                      times 64-$+message db 0

       which defines the string ‘abcabcabc’, followed by the right  number  of
       zero bytes to make the total length up to 64 bytes.

       _S_y_m_b_o_l  _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s  are  always  understood  to  be immediate (i.e. the
       address of the symbol), unless square brackets are used, in which  case
       the contents of the memory location are used. Thus:

                      mov ax,wordvar

       loads AX with the address of the variable ‘wordvar’, whereas

                      mov ax,[wordvar]
                      mov ax,[wordvar+1]
                      mov ax,[es:wordvar+bx]

       all refer to the _c_o_n_t_e_n_t_s of memory locations. The syntaxes

                      mov ax,es:wordvar[bx]
                      es mov ax,wordvar[1]

       are not legal at all, although the use of a segment register name as an
       instruction prefix is valid, and can be used with instructions such  as
       _L_O_D_S_B which can’t be overridden any other way.

       _C_o_n_s_t_a_n_t_s may be expressed numerically in most formats: a trailing H, Q
       or B denotes hex, octal or binary respectively, and a leading  ‘0x’  or
       ‘$’  denotes  hex  as  well. Leading zeros are not treated specially at
       all.  Character constants may be enclosed in single or  double  quotes;
       there is no escape character. The ordering is little-endian (reversed),
       so that the  character  constant  _’_a_b_c_d_’  denotes  0x64636261  and  not
       0x61626364.

       _L_o_c_a_l  _l_a_b_e_l_s  begin  with a period, and their ‘locality’ is granted by
       the assembler prepending the name of  the  previous  non-local  symbol.
       Thus  declaring  a  label  ‘.loop’  after  a label ‘label’ has actually
       defined a symbol called ‘label.loop’.

   DDIIRREECCTTIIVVEESS
       _S_E_C_T_I_O_N _n_a_m_e or _S_E_G_M_E_N_T _n_a_m_e causes nnaassmm to direct all  following  code
       to  the  named  section.  Section  names  vary with output file format,
       although most formats support the names _._t_e_x_t, _._d_a_t_a  and  _._b_s_s.   (The
       exception is the _o_b_j format, in which all segments are user-definable.)

       _A_B_S_O_L_U_T_E _a_d_d_r_e_s_s causes nnaassmm to position its notional assembly point at
       an  absolute  address: so no code or data may be generated, but you can
       use _R_E_S_B, _R_E_S_W and _R_E_S_D to move the assembly point further on, and  you
       can  define labels. So this directive may be used to define data struc-
       tures. When you have finished doing absolute assembly, you  must  issue
       another _S_E_C_T_I_O_N directive to return to normal assembly.

       _B_I_T_S  _1_6_,  _B_I_T_S  _3_2  or _B_I_T_S _6_4 switches the default processor mode for
       which nnaassmm is generating code: it is equivalent to _U_S_E_1_6  or  _U_S_E_3_2  in
       DOS assemblers.

       _E_X_T_E_R_N  _s_y_m_b_o_l  and _G_L_O_B_A_L _s_y_m_b_o_l import and export symbol definitions,
       respectively, from and to other modules. Note that the _G_L_O_B_A_L directive
       must appear before the definition of the symbol it refers to.

       _S_T_R_U_C  _s_t_r_u_c_n_a_m_e  and  _E_N_D_S_T_R_U_C, when used to bracket a number of _R_E_S_B,
       _R_E_S_W or similar instructions, define a data structure. In  addition  to
       defining  the  offsets  of  the  structure  members, the construct also
       defines a symbol for the size of the structure,  which  is  simply  the
       structure name with ___s_i_z_e tacked on to the end.

   FFOORRMMAATT--SSPPEECCIIFFIICC DDIIRREECCTTIIVVEESS
       _O_R_G  _a_d_d_r_e_s_s  is  used  by  the _b_i_n flat-form binary output format, and
       specifies the address at which  the  output  code  will  eventually  be
       loaded.

       _G_R_O_U_P  _g_r_p_n_a_m_e _s_e_g_1 _s_e_g_2_._._.  is used by the _o_b_j (Microsoft 16-bit) out-
       put format, and defines segment groups. This format  also  uses  _U_P_P_E_R_-
       _C_A_S_E,  which directs that all segment, group and symbol names output to
       the object file should be in uppercase. Note that the  actual  assembly
       is still case sensitive.

       _L_I_B_R_A_R_Y  _l_i_b_n_a_m_e  is used by the _r_d_f output format, and causes a depen-
       dency record to be written to the output file which indicates that  the
       program requires a certain library in order to run.

   MMAACCRROO PPRREEPPRROOCCEESSSSOORR
       Single-line  macros are defined using the _%_d_e_f_i_n_e or _%_i_d_e_f_i_n_e commands,
       in a similar fashion to the C preprocessor. They can be overloaded with
       respect  to  number  of  parameters,  although defining a macro with no
       parameters prevents the definition of any macro with the same name tak-
       ing  parameters,  and  vice  versa.  _%_d_e_f_i_n_e defines macros whose names
       match  case-sensitively,  whereas  _%_i_d_e_f_i_n_e  defines   case-insensitive
       macros.

       Multi-line macros are defined using _%_m_a_c_r_o and _%_i_m_a_c_r_o (the distinction
       is the same as that between _%_d_e_f_i_n_e and _%_i_d_e_f_i_n_e), whose syntax  is  as
       follows:

             %macro _n_a_m_e _m_i_n_p_r_m[-_m_a_x_p_r_m][+][.nolist] [_d_e_f_a_u_l_t_s]
                      <some lines of macro expansion text>
             %endmacro

       Again, these macros may be overloaded. The trailing plus sign indicates
       that any parameters after the last one get subsumed, with  their  sepa-
       rating  commas,  into the last parameter. The _d_e_f_a_u_l_t_s part can be used
       to specify defaults for unspecified macro  parameters  after  _m_i_n_p_a_r_a_m.
       _%_e_n_d_m is a valid synonym for _%_e_n_d_m_a_c_r_o.

       To  refer to the macro parameters within a macro expansion, you use _%_1,
       _%_2 and so on. You can also enforce that a macro parameter  should  con-
       tain  a  condition  code by using _%_+_1, and you can invert the condition
       code by using _%_-_1.  You can also define a label  specific  to  a  macro
       invocation by prefixing it with a double % sign.

       Files can be included using the _%_i_n_c_l_u_d_e directive, which works like C.

       The preprocessor has a ‘context stack’, which may be used by one  macro
       to  store  information  that  a later one will retrieve. You can push a
       context on the stack using _%_p_u_s_h, remove one using _%_p_o_p, and change the
       name of the top context (without disturbing any associated definitions)
       using _%_r_e_p_l.  Labels and _%_d_e_f_i_n_e macros specific to the top context may
       be defined by prefixing their names with %$, and things specific to the
       next context down with %$$, and so on.

       Conditional assembly is done by means of  _%_i_f_d_e_f,  _%_i_f_n_d_e_f,  _%_e_l_s_e  and
       _%_e_n_d_i_f  as  in C. (Except that _%_i_f_d_e_f can accept several putative macro
       names, and will evaluate TRUE if any of them is defined.) In  addition,
       the  directives _%_i_f_c_t_x and _%_i_f_n_c_t_x can be used to condition on the name
       of the top context on the context stack. The obvious set  of  ‘else-if’
       directives,  _%_e_l_i_f_d_e_f,  _%_e_l_i_f_n_d_e_f, _%_e_l_i_f_c_t_x and _%_e_l_i_f_n_c_t_x are also sup-
       ported.
